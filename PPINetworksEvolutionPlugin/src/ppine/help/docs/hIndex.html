        <h1>NetworkEvolution plugin</h1>
        The <i>NetworkEvolution</i> plugin is a tool for interactive comparative
analysis of networks across different species. Our primary goal here
is to allow the user to walk step-by-step through the process of
evolution of a selected network module. This process possibly includes
protein duplications, losses and speciation, as well as the emergence
or deletion of network links. Parent-child and sibling-sibling
relationships between homologous proteins are also taken into account
and color-coded to allow visual interpretation. Standard input data is
provided by the CAPPI procedure (Dutkowski and Tiuryn, Bioinformatics
2007). The data includes the species tree, protein family trees,
reconstructed interaction networks and experimentally identified
interactions.
        <br> It is an open source application (GPL 3 license).
        The plugin jar file, instructions and sources are available at:

        Please don't hesitate to contact us with any comments and suggestion or if you are interested in co-developing this
        software.
