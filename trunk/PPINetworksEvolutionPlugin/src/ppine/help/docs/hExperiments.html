        <h1>PPI experiment data</h1>
        There is a significant conceptual difference between the experimental
data and interaction data (discussed in the previous section). For the
interaction data we assume that in each species two proteins can be
connected by an interaction and this happens with a certain
probability (confidence level). In case of the experimental data,
there may be multiple cases in which an interaction was observed
(multiple publications). An interaction (from the interaction data)
could also not be observed in any particular experiment for a given
species, but still have a non-zero probability  based on experimental
evidence in other species. Providing experimental interactions is
optional. <br />
Experimentally identified PPI should be loaded in TAB delimited format. Each line should provide the following four fields for one
particular interaction:<br>
proteinName1 proteinName2 speciesName experimentID

The interactions from the same experiment will have the same color in
the visualizations. The tool-tip interface additionally provides the experiment
id (e.g. PUBMED ID) for each interaction.
