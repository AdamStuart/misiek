        <h1>Affinity implementations</h1>
        I have prepared (as authors) two implementations of Affinity algorithm. <br>
        First working on 2D matrix, and secend on sibling lists. <br>
        I have implemented it as two subclasses of AffinityPropagationAlgorithm class. <br>
        You are able to choose one of them.
