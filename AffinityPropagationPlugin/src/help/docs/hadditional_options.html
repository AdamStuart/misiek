        <h1>Assigning nodes to the nearest center</h1>
After the cluster centers (exemplars) are determined in the first phase of the algorithm, each node is assigned to the nearest center.
Our implementation provides the following options:
        <ul>
            <li>
Original method (follows the original AP implementations): <br>
For every node we look for neighbors which are cluster centers and assign the node to the nearest one. If depth is greater
than 1 then we allow indirectly connected nodes to be assigned to the center (this extends the original method).
            </li>
            <li>
Weighted BSF method (specific to our plugin): <br>
In the case of incomplete graphs (especially sparse graphs), it is possible that none of the nodes neighbors will be a cluster
center. When this option is selected, we look for shortest paths in the weighted network from nodes to cluster centers.
            </li>
        </ul>
