        <h1>Nearest center searching</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        After I phase we have clusters centers, now we have to find for every node
        nearest cluster center. <br>
        I have implemented two methods of it.
        <h2>Original authors method</h2>
        For every node we are looking for siblings, if one of siblings nodes is
        cluster center, we aggregate this nodes. But it is possible that some node
        hasn't center in nearest sibling, so I have generalized this method on
        any depth.
        <h2>Weighted BSF method</h2>
        This method looking from other side - starting from centers. Rightly it is
        Prime algorithm, where centers are sourse, and for every node we searching
        nearest path from sourse to this node.
