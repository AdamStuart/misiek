        <h1>Assigning nodes to the nearest center</h1>

        After the cluster centers are determined in the first phase of the algorithm, each node is assigned to the nearest center.<br>
        Our implementation provides the following options.
        <h2>Original method (follows the original AP implementations)</h2>
        For every node we look for neighbors which are cluster centers and assign the node to the nearest one.

        <h2>Weighted BSF method</h2>
        In the case of incomplete graphs (especially sparse graphs), it is possible that none of the node's neighbors will be a cluster center.<br>
        When this option is selected, we look for shortest paths in the weighted network from nodes to cluster centers.
